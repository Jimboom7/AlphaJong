# Mahjong Soul Javascript Documentation
An overview of useful objects, functions and variables in the Mahjong Soul Sourcecode.  
This does by no means cover everything, it's just some stuff that seems interesting and is/can be used by AlphaJong.  

## view.DesktopMgr
Contains data related to the game that is currently ongoing.  
**Careful:** Can be null if no match was started yet, or can contain old data after a game is finished.  
Is a singleton, view.DesktopMgr.Inst is usually what you want to access.  

### Useful Data
**view.DesktopMgr.Inst.oplist** - List of operations available for the player (call a pon etc.). The datapoint "combination" contains the combination of tiles for the call(multiple are possible).  mjcore.E_PlayOperation contains all operations with their IDs, see "Others" for more info.  
**view.DesktopMgr.Inst.dora** - Dora indicator.  
**view.DesktopMgr.Inst.players[number]** - Data of the players. 0 is the player himself. Contains lots of data, .hand for example are the tiles in the hand (unknown for other players), .container_qipai the discards and .container_ming.pais the called tiles, .score the Score.  
**view.DesktopMgr.Inst.left_tile_count** - Amount of tiles left.  
**view.DesktopMgr.Inst.localPosition2Seat(player)** - A function to convert the local position to the seat. Opposite: view.DesktopMgr.Inst.seat2LocalPosition(playerSeat);

**return view.DesktopMgr.Inst.game_config.mode.mode** - Gamemode: 1 = East Round, 2 = South Round  
**return view.DesktopMgr.Inst.game_config.meta.mode_id** The Room ID (e.g. 4 player Gold East is 8)

## GameMgr.Inst
Contains data of everything that is not related to the ongoing game, like player data or connection status.  
Is a singleton, GameMgr.Inst is usually what you want to access.  

### Useful Data

**GameMgr.client_language** - Language of the Client: Can be "en", "chs", "chs_t" or "jp"  


## uiscript
Contains data of UI elements. Although the name suggests otherwise, this does not only contain pure visual UI functions.  
uiscript contains lots of different UI elements which are again singletons. They will still exist even after they are closed (enabled is set to false then; usually they can be closed with Inst.close() and Inst.show()), but the initialization might occur later (e.g. starting an actual match).

### Useful Data

### Laya
Laya is the engine used by Mahjong Soul. The documentation can be found here: [Documentation (layabox.com)](http://layaair.ldc.layabox.com/api/English/). Not sure if this is of any use, AlphaJong doesn't touch this at the moment.
